# Java Duck Hunt
## Welcome to Duck Hunt! ðŸ¦†ðŸŽ® This is a fun and nostalgic DuckHunt game I designed to level up my OOP and GUI skills in Java. Get ready to shoot some virtual ducks and improve your programming chops in the process. Have a quacking good time!

### Gameplay

- In the main menu, press ENTER to start the game and ESCAPE to exit the game. 

- On the background selection screen, you can select the background with the right and left arrow keys and change the crosshair color with the up and down arrow keys. Press ENTER to start the game and ESCAPE to return to the main menu.

- After the music, the game starts. In each level you have 3 times as many bullets as the number of ducks. If there is a duck left alive when you run out of bullets, you lose the game. 

- Ducks can bounce off the edges of the screen or hit each other.

- When you move the crosshair closer to the right or left side of the screen, the screen slowly moves in that direction. 

- When you finish all 6 levels you win the game.

  

## Have FUN!
